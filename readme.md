🛒 Categorized E-commerce App (MongoDB + .populate)
📌 Description
This project is focused on learning categorization in MongoDB using the .populate() method to simulate table joins. It demonstrates how to build relationships between Categories (e.g., Electronics), Subcategories (e.g., Mobiles), and Extra Categories (e.g., Oppo Phones).

To make the learning more practical, the project is built like a mini e-commerce website, divided into:

Client Side – Public-facing site visible to users.

Admin Side – A protected section for managing categories, accessible via /admin/dashboard.

🛠 Libraries/Technologies Used
MongoDB + Mongoose – For database and .populate() operations

Express.js – Backend framework

EJS – Template engine for rendering dynamic HTML

Passport.js – For route protection & login

Multer – For handling image/file uploads

Bootstrap 5 – For styling the frontend

JavaScript – For frontend interactivity
